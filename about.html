      <p id="about-body">
        I have been developing ecommerce applications since 2008. In my spare time, I hack on open source shopping cart plugins and ecommerce libraries. Many of these are available to the public on my  <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}">Github profile</a>. This website is a blog where I write about developing web software and contributing to open source projects.
