    I specialize in working with entrepreneurs to bring their business ideas to life and grow their product. Over the years I have contributed to dozens of open source eCommerce applications and I draw on this experience to built and deploy quality software for my clients. Whether you have an existing application that needs some work or you are starting your online business from scratch, I like to see how I can help.
